       "'IDF soldiers should refuse orders that may be war crimes Israeli exsecurity adviser tells BBC IDF could be committing war crimes in northern Gaza says Eran Etzion As someone who served four Israeli prime ministers and was deputy head of the countrys National Security Council Eran Etzions judgement was trusted at the highest levels of the state A longstanding critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he is also someone whose years of public service earned him widespread respect But now Mr Etzion a former soldier himself is warning that Israels military the Israel Defense Forces IDF might be committing war crimes in northern Gaza And he is suggesting that officers and troops should reject illegal orders They should refuse If a soldier or an officer is expected to commit something that might be suspected as a war crime they must refuse Thats what I would do if I were a soldier Thats what I think any Israeli soldier should do he tells me We are sitting on the balcony of his home in Shoresh in central Israel Here there is the quiet sunshine of an autumn morning A peaceful neighbourhood where some builders are working on house improvements A man is comforted at the Gaza Strips Kamal Adwan Hospital which has been described as completely overwhelmed by Medecins Sans Frontieres Less than 40 miles down the road is the Gaza neighbourhood of Jabalia As Mr Etzion and I are speaking doctors and medical staff at the Indonesian Hospital in Jabalia are sending desperate voice notes to the international community begging for aid One senior nurse in a message heard by the BBC speaks in an exhausted voice of relentless privations allegedly imposed by the Israelis besieging Jabalia My friend Im so so tired he says I cant explain how tired I am The water is empty We dont have water We contacted the Israeli force to allow us to charge water to the tank but they dont accept that And we dont know what will happen tomorrow The situation is very very bad Another nurse says I am sorry for my language I cant talk well I am very fatigued and dizzy I havent eaten since yesterday We try to give the food that we found to the patients and families and we dont eat ourselves Tens of thousands of people are now fleeing Jabalia as the Israeli army continues its offensive against what it says is an attempt by Hamas to regroup Mr Etzion is worried for the civilians of Jabalia and his country There is a very dangerous erosion of norms There is a very widespread sense of revenge of rage he says This is because Mr Etzion says Israel is in the grip of trauma after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks in which around 1200 Israelis were killed and more than 200 taken hostage into Gaza Voice note from nurse describes conditions at a hospital in Jabalia The will to revenge could be understood Its human but were not a gang were not a terror organisation and were not a militia Were a sovereign country We have our history we have our morals we have our values and we must operate under international law and under international standards if we want to continue to be a member of the international community which we do He is speaking out as a former soldier as someone whose children served in the IDF and whose family and friends still serve Im just a concerned citizen trying to raise my voice So thats what Im doing I want to make sure that no soldier is involved in anything that could be constituted as a war crime Israel has faced mounting international criticism over its conduct during the war The United States has threatened to cut arms shipments if Israel does not surge aid into Gaza The UN has accused the Israelis of repeatedly blocking or impeding the transfer of aid most recently into northern Gaza The IDF has consistently rejected allegations that it is implementing a deliberate policy of starvation to force residents to flee from Jabalia Israel has long accused Hamas of using the civilian population as human shields launching attacks from schools and medical facilities Hamas does not hesitate to abuse Gazans exploit them steal aid from them and forcefully prevent them from evacuating when it is necessary for them to do so the IDF said in May A wounded girl is treated at the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza One of Britains most prominent war crimes lawyers Prof Philippe Sands KC told me that that while Israel had a right to self defence after the 7 October attacks it was now violating international law It has to be proportionate It has to meet the requirements of international humanitarian law It must distinguish between civilians and military targets It doesnt allow you to use famine as a weapon of war It doesnt allow you to forcibly deport or evacuate large numbers of people So its impossible to see what is going on now in Gaza as its impossible to see what happened on 7 October and not say crimes are screaming out Prof Sands has led the genocide case against Myanmar and the case for Palestinian statehood at the International Court of Justice in the Hague His book East West Street On the Origins of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity won the Baillie Gifford Prize for nonfiction The book also details his own Jewish familys experience of the Holocaust War crimes lawyer Prof Philippe Sands KC told the BBC Israel is violating international law'"
